p2pool-node-status
==================

This is a more modern looking p2pool node dashboard, which aims at 
p2pool nodes with multiple miners.

This version displays local, pool and network hashrates, expected time
to block or share, the pool minimum share difficulty etc. It includes auto-
update for graph, miners and blocks.

For each miner the individual share difficulty plus expected time to share is
displayed (this feature needs a patch to p2pool, currently included in the
p2pool-vtc version, see https://github.com/donSchoe/p2pool-vtc/pull/7 ).

Besides new features this version contains a bunch of bugfixes to the original
script. Hope you like it.

=======================

An alternative clean p2pool node dashboard. It uses Bootstrap, jQuery and Highcharts.

## Installation

On your p2pool node in web-static directory do:

```
git clone https://github.com/johndoe75/p2pool-node-status.git
```

If you want your miner address highlighted, adjust `myself` variable accordingly. E. g.

``` JavaScript
var myself= [
  '1MzFr1eKzLEC1tuoZ7URMB7WWBMgHKimKe'
];
```
